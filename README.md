# Shit Show (Global Gam Jam 2024)
Your local Comedy Club is hosting a special event--Vegan Night, for a special guest performance. The entry to the night must be a vegetable or fruit...
But you take your jokes very seriously, and the comedian sucks.

# How-To-Play

1. Throw a tomato by holding the left-click on your mouse or the space bar and releasing it on the comedian's head.
2. Use W-A-S-D to run away from the security guards.
3. Hit the comedian in the face as many times as you can before you get caught!
